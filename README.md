# Godot-Acrylic

An effect similar to Microsoft's [Acrylic](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/style/acrylic) and [Mica](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/style/mica?source=recommendations) materials achieved in Godot 3.
It works by getting the wallpaper file and bluring it in the engine.

## Limitations

- Implemented on Windows and Linux, but the fallback system is not great.
- Doesn't account for other windows (only blurs the background image)
